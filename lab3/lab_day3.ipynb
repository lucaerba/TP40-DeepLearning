    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "**Transfer learning** consists of taking features learned on one problem, and\n",
    "leveraging them on a new, similar problem. For instance, features from a model that has learned to identify racoons may be useful to kick-start a model meant to identify tanukis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Transfer learning is usually done for tasks where your dataset has too little data to  train a full-scale model from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common incarnation of transfer learning in the context of deep learning is the following workflow:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. take layers from a previously trained model;\n",
    "2. freeze them, so as to avoid destroying any of the information they contain during future training rounds;\n",
    "3. add some new, trainable layers on top of the frozen layers. They will learn to turn the old features into predictions on a  new dataset;\n",
    "4. train the new layers on your dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "A last, optional step, is **fine-tuning**, which consists of unfreezing the entire model you obtained above (or part of it), and re-training it on the new data with a very low learning rate. This can potentially achieve meaningful improvements, by incrementally adapting the pretrained features to the new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we will go over the Keras `trainable` API in detail, which underlies most transfer learning & fine-tuning workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, we'll demonstrate the typical workflow by taking a model pretrained on the\n",
    "ImageNet dataset, and retraining it on the Kaggle \"cats vs dogs\" classification dataset."

    "1. Instantiate a base model and load pre-trained weights into it.\n",
    "2. Run your new dataset through it and record the output of one (or several) layers\n",
    " from the base model. This is called **feature extraction**.\n",
    "3. Use that output as input data for a new, smaller model.\n",
    "\n",
    "A key advantage of that second workflow is that you only run the base model once on\n",
    " your data, rather than once per epoch of training. So it's a lot faster & cheaper.\n",
    "\n",
    "An issue with that second workflow, though, is that it doesn't allow you to dynamically\n",

    "your new dataset has too little data to train a full-scale model from scratch, and in\n",
    "such scenarios data augmentation is very important. So in what follows, we will focus\n",
